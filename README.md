djangostuff is a repo with a few django samples, utilizing Alpine.js, HTMX and Tailwind CSS. Feel free to grab what you want

1. The "columnsort" app is my first attempt on using Alpine.js, so I'm sure there's a lot to be desired in the quality of the code. If you have improvements please share. After **_python manage.py migrate_**, run **_python manage.py makedata_** to populate the database with sample data.
